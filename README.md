## Things to do

- Include email and other information for the API
- Modularize the app and improve the order of functions and the formation of the tibble, also deal better with errors and remove unnecesary things in the scripts for the functions
- Show instructions and "good"/"bad" examples of search queries

- Add the option to retrieve the references from medrxiv too
- Add aditional features like including references from Zotero
- Include a second layer (or third?) of references from the first references to add more PMIDs to the pool and that way increase the chances of finding more highly cited articles related to the topic
