# Find main references of a topic

This repo contains the code for the Shiny app to obtain the articles with more citations related to specific topics.


## Things to do

- Include email and other information for the API
- Create documentation about how to use it, when to use it and examples

- Add aditional features like including references from Zotero or, maybe more important, export the selected articles in some format (maybe BIB file)
