<b>Instructions:</b>

<div>The search query searches articles in PubMed using an API, 
so the same strategies used in PubMed also can be used in this app, so
Boolean operators, search tags, filter strategies work the same way as in Pubmed.
This means that using your search query you could filter you search in many
different ways.
E.g. to create a search query 
for articles about COVID-19 and anemia published during the last year 
you could create a string like: 
<pre>(anemia OR anaemia) AND \"last year\"[dp] AND covid</pre>
Or if you want to search review articles about diabetes in Spanish published between 
2010 and 2015 you could create a search query like <pre>diabetes AND spanish[la] AND 
2010:2015[dp] AND review[pt]</pre></div>
<br>
<div>Besides the search query it is the option of limit the number of articles obtained from
the search, increasing the number increases the time needed to obtain the references from
all of the articles searched, but it depends on the number of articles available too.</div>
<br>
<div>After searching the articles you have the option of download the information of the most cited
articles from the search.</div>
