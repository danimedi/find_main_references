E.g. to create a search query for articles about COVID-19 and anemia published during the last year you could create a string like: <pre>(anemia OR anaemia) AND "last year"[dp] AND covid</pre> Or if you want to search review articles about diabetes in Spanish published between 2010 and 2015 you could create a search query like <pre>diabetes AND spanish[la] AND 2010:2015[dp] AND review[pt]</pre>
